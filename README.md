# Recommendation Systems

A recommendation system is a type of algorithm designed to recommend or suggest things to the user based on many different factors. The recommendation system deals with a large amount of data and filters it out based on userâ€™s preferences and interests. With the rise of Youtube, Netflix, Amazon, etc., recommendation systems have taken a crucial place. Recommender systems are critical in many industries as they can help to generate a large amount of revenue. This series of projects aims to introduce recommendation systems and several algorithms used for recommendation.
